# Python laboratory - code here is tested with Python 2.7.1

### Image quality check process: getimagesize.py

The following problem is solved: 

Loop through all images  - get names from MySQL database 
Get image size without downloading it (they are HQ images - 4000 x 3000 pixels) from the first 1024 bytes of the file
If image is too small, put its name in a local file for further info
